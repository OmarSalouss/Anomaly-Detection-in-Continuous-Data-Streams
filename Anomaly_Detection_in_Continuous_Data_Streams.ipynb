This data stream simulates real-time sequences of floating-point numbers, representing various metrics, such as financial transactions or system metrics.

        "\n",
        "- ### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\n",
        "The EMA is an effective method for smoothing time-series data, which helps in detecting anomalies by focusing more on recent observations. It calculates a weighted average of the past data points, with the latest points having more significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ### Isolation Forest\n",
        "Isolation Forest is a robust algorithm designed specifically for anomaly detection. It works by isolating observations in a random partitioning tree structure. Anomalies are expected to be easier to isolate, leading to shorter paths in the tree. This method is particularly effective for high-dimensional datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ### Effectiveness\n",
        "The combination of EMA and Isolation Forest allows the system to adapt to seasonal variations and detect both point anomalies and batch anomalies efficiently. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is continuously generated, as it balances real-time detection with accuracy."

        "\n",
        "In this project, I chose to implement two algorithms for anomaly detection: the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Isolation Forest. The EMA is particularly effective for real-time data streams, as it adapts quickly to changes in data trends and provides a smoothing mechanism that allows for the detection of deviations from typical patterns. This is essential when monitoring metrics that may have seasonal fluctuations or concept drift. On the other hand, the Isolation Forest is a robust machine learning model specifically designed for anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets. It excels at identifying anomalies based on the concept of isolating observations in the feature space, making it highly effective for batch processing of data points. By combining these two approaches, the system leverages the strengths of both real-time adaptation and batch anomaly detection, thus ensuring a comprehensive and effective anomaly detection mechanism."
